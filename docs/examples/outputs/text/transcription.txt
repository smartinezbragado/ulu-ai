So we want to show people, most importantly, that this is possible, that that's the future we could have, where the curve slowly rolls over and goes to zero, no incremental CO2. That's the future we need to have. And the path that I've talked about, the solar panels and the batteries, it's the only path that I know that can do this. And I think it's something that we must do, and we can do, and that we will do.
